# Section 1

- Revolutions frame their language in terms of earlier ones, this masks their true nature
- There were 3 phases
  - the provisional government
  - the constitutional assembly
  - the legislative assembly

During the provisional government nobody knew who was in charge

The consitutional assembly immediately issued anti-proletariat laws. The failure of the July uprising, the killing, arrest and exile of its leaders, meant the proletariat played no significant part in subsequent events, except to join with various classes as each was defeated in turn.
